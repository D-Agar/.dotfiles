To learn the basics of lua:
  - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
- :help lua-guide
- (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

Kickstart Guide:

  TODO: The very first thing you should do is to run the command `:Tutor` in Neovim.
  NOTE: I am at lesson 5.1

  Once you've completed that, you can continue working through **AND READING** the rest
  of the kickstart init.lua.

  Next, run AND READ `:help`.
    This will open up a help window with some basic information
    about reading, navigating and searching the builtin help documentation.

    This should be the first place you go to look when you're stuck or confused
    with something. It's one of my favorite Neovim features.

    MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
    which is very useful when you're not exactly sure of what you're looking for.

If you experience any errors while trying to install kickstart, run `:checkhealth` for more info.

I hope you enjoy your Neovim journey,
- TJ

-- Set <space> as the leader key
-- See `:help mapleader`
--  NOTE: Must happen before plugins are loaded (otherwise wrong leader will be used)
vim.g.mapleader = " "
vim.g.maplocalleader = " "

-- Set to true if you have a Nerd Font installed and selected in the terminal
vim.g.have_nerd_font = true

-- For additional information with loading, sourcing and examples see `:help lazy.nvim-🔌-plugin-spec`
-- Or use telescope!
-- In normal mode type `<space>sh` then write `lazy.nvim-plugin`
-- you can continue same window with `<space>sr` which resumes last telescope search
